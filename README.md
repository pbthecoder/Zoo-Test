# Welcome to Zooscape, 
A game where you create your very own zoo. With over 250 animals (and counting), this zoo allows you to make the zoo of your dreams. 

"Welcome to the Zooscape, where your wildest dreams come to life! In this extraordinary zoo-building adventure, you have access to a vast library of over ??? animals. Unleash your creativity as you design a zoo beyond imagination, where bioengineering technology is at your fingertips. With the power to extract and alter DNA, you can create astonishing hybrids and abnormal bestial forms that push the boundaries of nature itself. But remember, with great power comes great responsibility. Treat the animals with care and respect, ensuring their welfare and providing them with biomes that are engineered to their species-specific needs. Immerse yourself in the universe of genetic manipulation and astonishing zoology practices in the Zoo of Imagination!"

# Update Log
  # 0.1.0 (Uguisu Ubuntu)
  Basic program for the shop, the animal book, and the zoo. The zoo is still in testing. A new, easier way to get animals into the game. This allows me to copy and paste animals simply using a text file

  # 0.1.1
  Miscellaneous added

  # 0.1.1.5 Errors
  Bugs arrived and now the only page you can open is Shop. Even with that being the only page you can open, it now has an unidentified bug. So development continues

  # 0.1.1.6 Errors Fixed (Opening Page Error)
  Jupyter Notebook changes fixed the problem. It is now not a problem

  # 0.1.2
  Finished exit function, finished misc. programs and pages

  # MONKEYTESTPACK
  The monkey test pack has been added, with four monkeys ready to get collected. 

  # 0.1.5
  Color and Boldness added. Wait was also added, along with the first Genetic Lab and the Cellshop has nothing in it. The Shop List is in a beautiful chart. 

# In Development 
   # 0.1.6
   More plot will be added to the game. More promo animals will be added, as well as being able to change names of the animals one buys. Another new feature is that now instead of not being able to earn money, visitors will come and visit. A new Credits / Licenses page will be added. 

   # Zoo Version 2 (Ithomiid Ubuntu)
   In the new version, you can 1) buy new plots of land, 2) see more zoomed-in versions of the habitat itself with a combination of ASCII and Unicode artistic symbols, and 3) "zoom in" on the animals and see the animals' names, ages, and any other needed information about them. 
   
  
# In the Future

  # Expansion Packs 0.0.9
  Class for Expansion Packs

  # Expansion Packs 1.0.0

  # 0.2.1
  The ability to add items inside the zoo feature, like bushes and et cetra, will be added. So far, nothing much is being brainstormed. 

  # First Playtester
  A new playtester will hopefully come to test the game and this will fix some minor bugs.
