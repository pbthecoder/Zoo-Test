# Welcome to Zooscape, 
A game where you create your very own zoo. With over 300 animals (and counting), this zoo allows you to make the zoo of your dreams. 

"Welcome to the Zooscape, where your wildest dreams come to life! In this extraordinary zoo-building adventure, you have access to a vast library of over 2,000 animals. Unleash your creativity as you design a zoo beyond imagination, where bioengineering technology is at your fingertips. With the power to extract and alter DNA, you can create astonishing hybrids and abnormal bestial forms that push the boundaries of nature itself. But remember, with great power comes great responsibility. Treat the animals with care and respect, ensuring their welfare and providing them with biomes that are engineered to their species-specific needs. Immerse yourself in the universe of genetic manipulation and astonishing zoology practices in the Zoo of Imagination!"

# Update Log
  # 0.1.0
  Basic program for the shop, the animal book, and the zoo. The zoo is still in testing. A new, easier way to get animals into the game. This allows me to copy and paste animals simply using a text file

  # 0.1.1
  Miscellaneous added

  # 0.1.1.5 Errors
  Bugs arrived and now the only page you can open is Shop. Even with that being the only page you can open, it now has an unidentified bug. So development continues

  # 0.1.1.6 Errors Fixed (Opening Page Error)
  Jupyter Notebook changes fixed the problem. It is now not a problem

  # 0.1.2
  Finished exit function, finished misc. programs and pages

# In Development
  # Expansion Packs Brainstorming
  Setting up which animals are in which packs. 

  Current Packs:
  Realm Pack
    -Kevin's Hamster
    -Phoenix Cat (FCPA)
  Indian Pack
    -Gaur
    -Dhole
    -Gharial
    -Great Indian Bustard
  Packs will contain the following:
  A number of animals + habitats
  Some Promo Codes
  
  # 0.1.3
  Color and Boldness added. This will take a significant amount of time, due to the large amount of print statements in the program. 

  UPDATE!
  Mostly complete, with a few printing problems with the function that colors the text.
  Just a few bugs needed to fix on the shop and the Animal Book. 
  
  # Genetic Manipulation 0.0.1
  Tests for changing genes

  UPDATE!
  Currently in a new fule (not uploaded). This required a few new changes to the text files, and a few more text files have been added. 
  It's looking pretty nice. 
  
  # Diversity 0.1.0
  Melanin and other chemical changes in color caused by the cell changing

  UPDATE!
  Going the same way as GeneManip 0.0.1
  
# In the Future

  # Habitats and Homes (Art Part)
  Start making the art for the whole game. This is going to take a pretty long time. 
  The art will be similar to Rimworld animals. 

  # The Big Kahuna- Pygame Translations
  Oh no. All the code will (probably at some point) be moved to PyGame. That's a lot of code.
